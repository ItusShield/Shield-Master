# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determine the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At the startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get a better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine need to
# prune before unsetting the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing to create new flows, but
# prunning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doens't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more agressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the last time seen flows
# not in use.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.

# This option controls the use of vlan ids in the flow (and defrag)

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determine the seconds to wait after a hanshake or
# stream startup before the engine free the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if it spend that amount
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero).
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.
# Some timeouts doesn't apply to all the protocols, like "closed", for udp and

# Please make sure you have ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"
# in /etc/loader.conf or kldload'ing the appropriate kernel modules.
# Additionally, you need to have an ipfw rule for the engine to see
# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# The 8000 above should be the same number you passed on the command
# line, i.e. -d 8000
#
ipfw:

  # Reinject packets at the specified ipfw rule number.  This config
  # option is the ipfw rule number AT WHICH rule processing continues
  # in the ipfw processing system after the engine has finished
  # inspecting the packet for acceptance.  If no rule number is specified,
  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
  #
  ## The following example tells the engine to reinject packets
  # back into the ipfw firewall AT rule number 5500:
  #
  # ipfw-reinjection-rule-number: 5500
